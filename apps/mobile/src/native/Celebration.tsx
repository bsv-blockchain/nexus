/**
 * Celebration checkmark — drawn check plus the success haptic, reserved for the
 * moments that have actually earned one. Everything else uses quiet feedback.
 *
 * BSV Browser allowed it exactly three callers: first payment sent, wallet
 * created, backup verified. In Nexus the last two happen in the DOM chrome, so
 * what is left here is money confirmed — which is the one this component was
 * really tuned for. Keep the list that short: a checkmark that appears for
 * routine outcomes stops meaning anything on the one screen where it must.
 *
 * The haptic fires from inside this component rather than from the screen, so a
 * caller cannot show the mark and forget the tap, or fire two of them.
 * Reduced motion collapses to a static check — the moment still lands, it just
 * does not draw.
