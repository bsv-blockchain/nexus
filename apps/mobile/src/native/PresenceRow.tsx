/**
 * Presence — the quiet line that says whether another person's device is
 * actually there.
 *
 * The nearby surface is the only place in this app with a live peer, and this
 * row is the only place that fact is visible. It is STATUS, not decoration:
 * every state below is entered from a real signal, and there is deliberately no
 * state for "we think they're probably nearby".
 *
 * ── Why there is no separate "device found" ──
 *
 * The AWDL transport surfaces exactly two things to JS: a decoded frame, or an
 * error (see packages/react-native-localpay-transport — `startListening`,
 * `sendFrame`). There is no connection callback, so neither side can observe
 * discovery separately from the TLS-PSK handshake. By the time anything reaches
 * JS, the peer has been found AND the encrypted channel has carried real bytes.
 * Those two facts arrive together, so they are one state — `linked` — rather
 * than an invented pair of steps with a timer between them. Splitting them
 * would be theatre, and on a payment screen theatre is a lie about whether the
 * other device is really there.
 *
 * ── The honest degrades ──
 *
 * `qr` exists because the QR hand-off has no live link at all. It must never
 * animate like a connection or borrow connection language: the payer's device
 * is not talking to the payee's, and pretending otherwise would tell someone a
 * stranger's phone is on the other end of a channel that does not exist.
 *
 * `ready` says a nearby route is *available* — the peer's pairing code claims
 * AWDL and this device supports it — not that anything is open yet.
 *
 * ── Colour ──
 *
 * Green appears on exactly one state, `paid`, because green on this screen
 * means confirmed money and nothing else. `linked` — the moment the other
 * person's device is proven present — earns its emphasis from weight and text
 * colour instead, never from the accent.
