/**
 * Local Payments — pay a nearby device.
 *
 * Three transports behind one user-facing flow, all bootstrapped by the same
 * pairing QR minted by the payee. selectTransport() picks the highest rung
 * both sides share:
 *
 *   AWDL    iOS↔iOS peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, TLS-PSK. Fast path.
 *   Nearby  Android↔Android over Google Nearby Connections, same Nitro surface.
 *   QR      any platform pair. The payer renders the signed frame; the payee scans it.
 *
 * Phase machine
 *
 *   entry
 *    ├─ receive_amount → receive_minting → receive_wait
 *    │      receive_wait always renders the pairing QR, and additionally runs a
 *    │      radio listener (AWDL or Nearby) when this device supports one. Either
 *    │      arrival lands in:
 *    │        · radio listener resolves ─┐
 *    │        · receive_scan (payer QR) ─┴→ receive_settling → done | already_paid
 *    └─ send_scan → send_confirm → send_working
 *           ├─ selectTransport() === 'awdl' | 'nearby' → radio.send → done
 *           └─ selectTransport() === 'qr'              → send_qr → done
 *
 *   already_paid is a SUCCESS terminal, not an error: the session was settled by
 *   an earlier delivery, so that money is already queued. It is the expected end
 *   of both legitimate rescan paths and must never offer a retry, because a retry
 *   mints a fresh session and invites a second payment.
 *
 *   failed is terminal for either role. It offers a retry, a route to Settings
 *   when Local Network access is the cause, a re-settle when a delivered frame
 *   could not be persisted, and — on a failed AWDL send — the already-built frame
 *   as a QR so the payment can still complete.
 *
 *   An AWDL listener error does NOT terminate the screen: the fast path is
 *   optional, so it degrades to a QR-only request with the pairing QR still up.
 *
 * The amount may come from EITHER side. A payee can name a figure or leave the
 * request open, in which case the payer enters it on the confirm screen. See
 * `Session.amount` and the settle-binding note below — the two cases differ in
 * exactly one check, and the difference is load-bearing.
 *
 * Money safety (see settleReceived below, which is the only write path):
 *   0. The frame is bound to the session before anything else: a frame whose
 *      derivation nonces do not match the live request — or whose amount
 *      contradicts an amount the payee actually asked for — is refused without
 *      burning the session, so the real payer can still pay.
 *   1. isSessionSpent() is consulted before anything is written.
 *   2. savePending() completes before markSessionSpent(). Never the reverse:
 *      a crash between the two would burn a one-shot session whose payment was
 *      never persisted, and that money is unrecoverable.
 *   3. processPending() runs only after savePending() has resolved, outside the
 *      try that can flip the screen to a failure. Once the frame is queued the
 *      payment cannot be lost, so reporting failure past that line would invite
 *      a duplicate payment — the same misreport refused for markSessionSpent.
 *   4. The live Session is threaded in as an argument — neither PaymentFrame
 *      nor PendingPayment carries a sessionId, so it cannot be recovered later.
 *   5. Every decode sits in a bare `catch`, which catches non-Error throws from
 *      atob and destructuring too, not just CodecError.
 *   6. Nothing decorative — identity lookup, the confirmation tone, presence —
 *      is ever awaited on a money path. They are all fire-and-forget.
 *
 * Money safety, payer side (see abortBuild below):
 *   The frame is built `noSend`, which holds `amount + fee` in inputs marked
 *   unspendable. Nothing in storage ever reaps a 'nosend' action, so an
 *   abandoned build locks those funds permanently. abortBuild() releases them —
 *   but ONLY on paths where the frame provably never left the device. Once
 *   delivery is even possible the action must stay intact, because the payee may
 *   still broadcast it and a freed input can be respent into a conflict.
 *
 * ── What changed coming across from BSV Browser ──
 *
 *   Presentation. BSV Browser mounted this inside an expo-router screen that
 *   supplied the header, the back button and the top inset; the scanner then
 *   went up in a nested <Modal>. Nexus has no router: NativeModalHost presents
 *   this full-screen and hands it one resolver, so the header lives here (the
 *   styles for it were already in this file, unused) and the scanner is an
 *   absolutely-positioned layer rather than a Modal — a second iOS window would
 *   sit above the layer the shell coordinates with the tab WebViews, and the tab
 *   layer would have no way to stand down for it.
 *
 *   Focus. expo-router's useFocusEffect is a plain mount effect here; see the
 *   note on `focused` below, which is load-bearing and NOT dropped.
 *
 *   Nothing else. Every transport decision, every money-safety ordering and
 *   every string is the source's.
 *
 * ── Design notes (see BSV Browser's .superpowers/sdd/2026-07-27-local-payments-awdl) ──
 *
 *   Density   8pt vertical rhythm throughout. 16pt gutter, 24pt between
 *             sections, 8pt within a group. Every vertical value on this screen
 *             is a multiple of 8 except hairlines and optical nudges.
 *   Type      Four levels, doing the hierarchy work together with weight and
 *             colour: display(44/700) · title2(22/700) · subhead(15/400) ·
 *             footnote(13/400). Never size alone.
 *   Colour    Green means confirmed money and nothing else. It appears on the
 *             celebration mark, the `paid` presence state, and the "added to
 *             your wallet" notice — nowhere decorative. Everything else is
 *             neutral structure.
 *   Motion    Transforms and opacity only, under 300ms, springs.snappy or
 *             easings.out. Nothing eases in; nothing starts from scale(0).
