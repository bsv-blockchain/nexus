/**
 * The moment money arrives.
 *
 * Full screen, and it stays until the person receiving taps Done. That is the
 * whole point: a toast is the right weight for "your settings were saved" and
 * the wrong weight for "someone just paid you" — it can be missed entirely if
 * the phone is face down, in a pocket, or simply not being looked at when it
 * fires, and the one thing a payee must never be unsure about is whether the
 * money arrived. Requiring an acknowledgement means the event cannot be missed,
 * only dismissed.
 *
 * Presentational only. It reports nothing and decides nothing — by the time it
 * mounts the payment is already credited, so dismissing it cannot affect money.
 *
 * Staged in three beats, as the nearby flow's success screen is: the amount is
 * already on screen when the mark begins drawing, the mark fires the success
 * haptic from inside Celebration, then the tone sounds. Firing them together
 * reads as one blunt event and buries the figure, which is the thing that
 * actually matters.
