 * Releases held transactions to the network, parents first.

 * ancestry can contain other people's unbroadcast transactions that were never
 * our queue rows, and those must go out before ours. Every held request stores
 * the full AtomicBEEF it arrived in (`proven_tx_reqs.inputBEEF`, written at
 * `storage/methods/internalizeAction.js:519`), so merging those beefs gives the
 * whole dependency graph.
 *
 * Transactions we own are posted through the toolbox's own
 * `attemptToPostReqsToNetwork`, which handles status transitions, history notes
 * and `markStaleInputsAsSpent`. Foreign ancestors have no request here, so they
 * are posted directly through `services.postBeef`.
 *
 * Every decision — the order, what a broadcast result means, who dies with whom
 * — lives in `utils/offline/plan.ts` and is unit-tested. What is left here is
 * database reads, writes and logging, which is validated on device.

 * Post a transaction this wallet owns, reusing the toolbox's bookkeeping.

 * `status: 'success'` for a request it merely parked, and a drain that read that
 * as delivery would mark the queue row 'sent' for a transaction nobody has. The
 * outcome is therefore taken from what storage records, not from what the post
 * reports — see `outcomeOfOwnedPost`.
 *
 * The request is left at 'nosend' for the post. `attemptToPostReqsToNetwork` has
 * no status gate (it screens on rawTx, notify.transactionIds and inputBEEF only,
 * `attemptToPostReqsToNetwork.js:61-99`), so promoting it first would buy nothing
 * and would briefly publish it at 'unsent' — the status `TaskSendWaiting` selects
 * — handing the monitor a chance to broadcast it out of dependency order.
 *
 * On anything but success the hold is restored. A service error otherwise leaves
 * the request at 'sending' with `attempts` incremented
 * (`attemptToPostReqsToNetwork.js:249-253`), which is exactly the state
 * `TaskSendWaiting` picks up every five minutes and `applyProofTimeout` eventually
 * marks 'invalid' (`EntityProvenTxReq.js:426-433`). Leaving it there would hand
 * back the very failure the hold exists to prevent, and out of dependency order at
 * that.
 *
 * That makes the post itself throwing the dangerous case, because the toolbox
 * persists the request's new status and only afterwards touches the transaction
 * rows and — on a failure — runs `markStaleInputsAsSpent`, which does live chain
 * queries. A throw past that first write would otherwise leave 'sending' behind
 * with no re-hold. So the post is guarded and a throw simply leaves `detailStatus`
 * undefined, letting the persisted status decide, which is what decides anyway.
 * The drain recovers from a stalled run; it cannot recover from an out-of-order
