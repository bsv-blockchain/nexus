  // Network.framework invokes every callback in this file (the listener's
  // `newConnectionHandler`/`stateUpdateHandler`, and every `NWConnection`'s
  // `receive`/`send` completions and `stateUpdateHandler`) on the queue that
  // was passed to that object's `start(queue:)` -- which is always `queue`
  // below, for both the listener and every connection it accepts, and for the
  // outbound connection in `sendFrame`. The public methods
  // (`startListening`/`stopListening`) are instead invoked from whatever
  // thread the JS bridge calls in on, which is NOT `queue`. So there are two
  // real threads that can touch this state, and every touch is confined to
  // `queue` on purpose: public entry points that mutate state wrap the
  // mutation in `queue.sync` (safe: they are never called while already on
  // `queue`), and code that Network.framework itself invokes -- already
  // running on `queue` -- touches the state directly, since dispatching to
  // (or synchronously re-entering) `queue` from there is unnecessary and
  // `queue.sync` from within `queue` would deadlock a serial queue.
