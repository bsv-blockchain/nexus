 *
 *  · sdk validationHelpers.js:458-460 — `isSendWith = sendWith.length > 0`, and
 *    `isNewTx` stays FALSE when there are no inputs and no outputs, so this
 *    builds nothing. `description` is still mandatory (5–2000 bytes, :438).
 *  · signer/methods/createAction.js:10-46 — with `isNewTx` false it skips
 *    straight to `processAction`, whose args carry `sendWith` and a null
 *    reference/txid/rawTx.
 *  · storage/methods/processAction.js:26 — the sendWith txids become
 *    `txidsOfReqsToShareWithWorld` and go to `shareReqsWithWorld`.
 *  · storage/storageProviderHelpers.js:14 — `readyToSendStatuses` includes
 *    'nosend', so a withheld req classifies as `readyToSend` (:28-35) →
 *    `SendWithResult.status = 'sending'` (processAction.js:64-66).
 *  · processAction.js:127-136 — on the default delayed path the req moves to
 *    'unsent' and the transaction to 'sending'. That is the escape from
 *    'nosend': monitor/tasks/TaskFailAbandoned.js:35 only ever sweeps
 *    ['unprocessed', 'unsigned'], so nothing else would have moved it.
 *
 * Reaching this through WalletPermissionsManager raises no prompt and cannot
 * abort the action: with no inputs or outputs the underlying createAction
 * returns no `signableTransaction`, and the manager returns at
 * WalletPermissionsManager.js:2856 before its spending-authorization gate.
