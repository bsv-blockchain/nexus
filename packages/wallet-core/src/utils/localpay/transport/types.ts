 * Polish error. The payer maps these to its own strings and falls back to
 * echoing anything it does not recognise.
 *
 * Every one of these means the payee queued NOTHING, so the payer may safely
 * release the inputs its `noSend` action is holding. Nothing that could leave
 * the payment half-committed may ever be reported as a decline.
