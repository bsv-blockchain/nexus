/**
 * A validated window of block headers, on disk, plus an in-memory merkle-root
 * index.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: `Beef.verify` needs exactly one thing — a merkle root for a
 * block height (@bsv/sdk Beef.js:702-707). Everything else about offline
 * payments follows from being able to answer that with no network.
 *
 * SHAPE: `<chain>.bin` holds contiguous 80-byte headers starting at
 * `anchor.height + 1`; `<chain>.json` holds the metadata; `<chain>-extra.json`
 * holds roots resolved below the window while online. On open, one pass over
 * the .bin builds a packed Uint8Array of 32-byte roots — ~1.7 MB for a year,
 * versus ~3.4 MB if they were kept as hex strings — so a lookup is an array
 * slice and a hex encode rather than file I/O.
 *
 * VALIDATION is a single pass per appended chunk: link each header to the
 * previous hash, hash it once, check that hash against the target its own bits
 * declare, and keep the root. Doing it here rather than calling the toolbox's
 * `validateBufferOfHeaders` avoids hashing every header twice, since that
 * helper checks linkage but not difficulty.
