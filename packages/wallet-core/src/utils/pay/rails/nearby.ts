/**
 * The nearby rail — in-person, device-to-device over AWDL or QR.
 *
 * A pass-through, on purpose. utils/localpay/* is device-proven with 210 tests
 * behind it and its money-safety invariants were verified line by line, so this
 * rail adds NOTHING: no wrappers, no defaults, no convenience. Its only job is
 * to be the single import site for nearby, so a future change cannot quietly
 * grow a second implementation between the screen and the transport.
 *
 * If you find yourself wanting to add a function here, add it to the caller
 * instead.

 * ids with switch hysteresis so one stray frame cannot erase a scan in

 * the renderer, because the library deliberately has no opinion on it.
