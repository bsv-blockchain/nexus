/**
 * The background address sweep.
 *
 * "Get paid → a conventional wallet" is: show the address, and money appears.

 * WalletContext owns its lifecycle, beside the localpay retry loop that already
 * runs there.
 *
 * Every bound is deliberate and tested: see shouldSweepNow for when a pass may
 * run at all, and utils/pay/watchlist.ts for which addresses it may touch.
