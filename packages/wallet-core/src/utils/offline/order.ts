 * (impossible in real transactions, possible in corrupt data) is dropped rather
 * than allowed to spin.
 *
 * Membership is deliberately the caller's decision, because the two callers
 * disagree about it. Releasing orders only what needs broadcasting. A cascade must
 * order **every** member, mined and txid-only included: those need no broadcast,
 * but their `failed` write still touches their neighbours' spendability, so leaving

  // can never end up after its child, so the tie-break between two unrelated
